# Project Title
Clock Degree Brain Teaser


## Background
I was given the following brain teaser:
> "What is the angle between the hour-hand and minute-hand of a clock at 3:30?"

After attempting to solve it by hand and hearing the solution, the teaser suck with me and I challenged myself to attempt to solve it programmatically with javascript. This is the solution.

## Viewing the project
Visit http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jonmorazav/clockDegreeBrainTeaser/blob/master/index.html
and pass in an hour and a minute to have it calculate the degree between the minute hand and hour hand.
